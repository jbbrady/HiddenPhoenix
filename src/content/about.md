## Who are you guys?

Hidden Phoenix is (currently) Jennifer Brady and Zach Wilder. 

Jennifer is **BIO REDACTED** - just kidding, she hasn't written one yet!

Zach is an ISA Certified Arborist, with (the majority of) his degree in Ecology
from the University of Arizona, and is a veteran of the US Navy. During his time
in the Navy, he had the opportunity to work in a natural resources office doing
trail maintenance, planting trees, prescribed burns, and cleaning up roadkill.
Between the Navy and the UofA he worked many (many) odd jobs, always hoping to
end up working outside. At the UofA he worked as a research assistant catching
rodents and bats with the mammology department, and assisted the Tree Ring
Institute with modernizing the software used for tree ring analysis. 

## Why?

Over the past few years of working together and sharing **MANY** stories,
adventures and cool plant finds in a shared group chat on our phones we often
thought about starting a website to archive all these tales - but never
mentioned it to each other. Until one day, as we were lamenting the lack of a good,
non-academic tree identification site for the Phoenix area specifically the idea
came up in conversation... One thing led to another and here we are!

Eventually, as the site continues to grow, the [tags](/tags) page will be useful
for identifying a plant or tree based on a single trait. That woody shrub you
keep pulling out of your alleyway has palmate leaves? Well, the tags page will
someday have a tag for that and a list of all the plants like that with pictures you can
scroll through - and maybe even learn something cool.

Our work has us encountering people in interesting places, and seeing cool
things, and finding new places to eat all over - and those stories will have a
home here as well. 

## Who built this site? How?

This site was built by Zach Wilder, using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The theme
is a heavily modified version of [XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) -
the source for the site is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/zwilder/hiddenphoenix).  He does all his work on an
old laptop running [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), writing everything
in [Vim](https://www.vim.org).  If anything is broken on the site and needs
fixing please don't hesitate to [email Zach](mailto:zwilder@hiddenphoenix.com)!
