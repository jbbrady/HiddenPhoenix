## Who are you guys?

Hidden Phoenix is (currently) Jennifer Brady and Zach Wilder. 

## Why?

Over the past few years of working together and sharing **MANY** stories,
adventures and cool plant finds in a shared group chat on our phones we often
thought about starting a website to archive all these tales - but never
mentioned it to each other. Until one day, as we were lamenting the lack of a good,
non-academic tree identification site for the Phoenix area specifically the idea
came up in conversation... One thing led to another and here we are!

Eventually, as the site continues to grow, the [tags](/tags) page will be useful
for identifying a plant or tree based on a single trait. That woody shrub you
keep pulling out of your alleyway has palmate leaves? Well, the tags page will
someday have a tag for that and a list of all the plants like that with pictures you can
scroll through - and maybe even learn something cool.

Our work has us encountering people in interesting places, and seeing cool
things, and finding new places to eat all over - and those stories will have a
home here as well. 

## Who built this site? How?

This site was built by Zach Wilder, using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The theme is a
heavily modified version of [XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) - the
source for the site is on [GitHub](https://github.com/zwilder/hiddenphoenix).
Zach does all his work on an old laptop running [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), writing everything in [Vim](https://www.vim.org).
If anything is broken on the site and needs fixing please don't hesitate to
email [Zach](mailto:zwilder@hiddenphoenix.com)!
