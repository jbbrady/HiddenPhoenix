# Introduction

This blog was started as an idea shared between a group of urban foresters -
tree and plant nerds who are lucky enough to spend their days working outside in
the Phoenix metro and surrounding areas, geeking out over the various flora and fauna
we come across. Our time working is mostly spent in the easements, alleyways,
canals, access roads, and other places rarely seen by the average citizen.
Our jobs require us to take a slow look at things that grow - no matter where
you are, if you look hard enough you can find treasure. 

Welcome to Hidden Phoenix - Enjoy your stay!
